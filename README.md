# Welcome to Lost Object

Javascript api created with the open data of SNCF. This api aims to help people find their lost object in station around the country ( it only works on France with SNCF for the moment )

### Installing

It's pretty simple to install and test this api

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Shein1/backObjetPerdu.git
```

Install all packages

```
npm install
```

Then run the seeder

```
npm run seed_object
```

Now let's run our server and use the api

```
npm start
```

Here some data you can get with this api :

```
{
    "found_object": [
        {
            "id": 789,
            "date": 4,
            "station": 6,
            "typeObject": 4,
            "natureObject": 5
        }
    ],
    "information": {
        "station": {
            "stationName": "La Rochelle"
        },
        "type": {
            "typeObject": "Optique"
        },
        "nature": {
            "natureObject": "Lunettes en Ã©tui"
        },
        "date": {
